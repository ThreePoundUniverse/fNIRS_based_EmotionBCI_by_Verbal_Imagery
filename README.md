## Abstract 
Objective. With the advantages of non-invasive, portable, and relatively high spatial resolution, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has the potential for developing a novel affective brain-computer interface (aBCI). Inner emotional imagery is important in regulating internal emotions and is expected to convey emotions to others. However, the neural mechanism of emotional imagery for aBCI is largely unclear. This study aims to observe the cortical response characteristics of emotional verbal imagery for fNIRS-based aBCI. Approach. This study designed a novel emotional verbal imagery paradigm (imagining descriptions of happy or sad scenes). Cortical hemodynamic responses of 17 subjects were acquired by using fNIRS. After signal pre-processing, the spatial response, laterality, and response contrast of happy and sad emotion imagery were analyzed. Main results. (1) Happy imagery recruited frontoparietal regions, such as the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral dorsal sensorimotor cortex (dSMC). (2) Sad imagery recruited the right DLPFC. (3) The left dSMC could help distinguish emotional valence, i.e., happy and sad imagery. Significance. By providing a novel emotional verbal imagery aBCI paradigm and revealing its cortical response characteristics by fNIRS, this study shed light on the development of future non-invasive BCI.
